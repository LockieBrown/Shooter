a simple game I made in a few weeks.

To play the game, go to the [shooter.exe](https://github.com/LockieBrown/Shooter/blob/main/Shooter.exe) file and download the raw code, and do the same for the [shooter.pck](https://github.com/LockieBrown/Shooter/blob/main/Shooter.pck), if you have both files in the same folder afterwards it will work

All code I have written is in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/LockieBrown/Shooter/tree/main/scripts) most code is in the player.gd, world.gd, enemy.gd, global.gd and a few others (a few of the more empty ones are just UI scripts to detect when the next button is pushed)

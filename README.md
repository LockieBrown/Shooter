a simple game i made in a few weeks.

to play, download the [shooter.zip](https://github.com/LockieBrown/Shooter/blob/main/Shooter.zip) file and the [shooter.pck](https://github.com/LockieBrown/Shooter/blob/main/Shooter.pck) and unzip the zip file, if you have both in the same folder afterwards it will work

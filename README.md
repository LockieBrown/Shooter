a simple game i made in a few weeks.

to play, go to the [shooter.exe](https://github.com/LockieBrown/Shooter/blob/main/Shooter.exe) file and download the raw code, and do the same for the [shooter.pck](https://github.com/LockieBrown/Shooter/blob/main/Shooter.pck), if you have both files in the same folder afterwards it will work

all code i have wrote is in the [scripts folder]()
